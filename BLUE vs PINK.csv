2021/04/02 5:23:04 PM GMT+11,6,7,BLUE AI,"They both felt pretty similar, but for me for some reason the pink one seemed to start off a little more hostile/indifferent and also became more cautious for a moment when I tried singing again. That makes it feel more real, I think? Because animals aren't always going to have the same temperament, etc.

That said I was probably a little bit hindered in exploring their differences by the fact that I wouldn't DARE use any of the negative actions, i would feel too bad for being mean."
